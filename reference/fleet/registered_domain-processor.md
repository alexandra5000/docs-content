# Registered Domain [registered_domain-processor]


The `registered_domain` processor reads a field containing a hostname and then writes the "registered domain" contained in the hostname to the target field. For example, given `www.google.co.uk`, the processor would output `google.co.uk`. In other words, the "registered domain" is the effective top-level domain (`co.uk`) plus one level (`google`). Optionally, the processor can store the rest of the domain, the `subdomain`, into another target field.

This processor uses the Mozilla Public Suffix list to determine the value.


## Example [_example_30]

```yaml
  - registered_domain:
      field: dns.question.name
      target_field: dns.question.registered_domain
      target_etld_field: dns.question.top_level_domain
      target_subdomain_field: dns.question.sudomain
      ignore_missing: true
      ignore_failure: true
```


## Configuration settings [_configuration_settings_35]

::::{note}
{{agent}} processors execute *before* ingest pipelines, which means that your processor configurations cannot refer to fields that are created by ingest pipelines or {{ls}}. For more limitations, refer to [What are some limitations of using processors?](/reference/fleet/agent-processors.md#limitations)
