Each cloud connected service has its own licensing and payment requirements. 

* AutoOps for ECE, ECK, and self-managed clusters is available for free across all [self-managed license types](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions). It does not consume ECUs.

* The Elastic {{infer-cap}} Service (EIS) for ECE, ECK, and self-managed clusters requires a [self-managed Enterprise license](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions) or a self-managed free trial. Note that [EIS pricing](/explore-analyze/elastic-inference/eis.md#pricing) is usage-based. Using EIS consumes ECUs.
