$$$single-cloud-org$$$**I’m trying to create a Cloud organization, but I’m already part of a different one.**
:   :::{include} /deploy-manage/monitor/_snippets/single-cloud-org.md
:::

$$$unistall-agent$$$**I need to uninstall {{agent}}.**
:   Refer to [](/solutions/security/configure-elastic-defend/uninstall-elastic-agent.md) for instructions.

$$$disconnected-cluster$$$**My cluster was disconnected from {{ecloud}} and I want to reconnect it.**
:   If the cluster was disconnected by one of the users in your Cloud organization, you can repeat the [installation process](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/cc-connect-self-managed-to-autoops.md) to reconnect. If not, explore [additional resources](/troubleshoot/index.md#troubleshoot-additional-resources) or [contact us](/troubleshoot/index.md#contact-us).

$$$next-steps$$$**After running the installation command, I can't move on to the next steps.**
:   If an error appears on the screen, follow the suggestion in the error message and try to run the command again. If the issue is not resolved, explore [additional resources](/troubleshoot/index.md#troubleshoot-additional-resources) or [contact us](/troubleshoot/index.md#contact-us).

:::{tip}
If you're having issues connecting your cluster to AutoOps and sending metrics to {{ecloud}}, run the [AutoOps Connectivity Check](../autoops/autoops-connectivity-check.md) to test your configuration.
:::

$$$firewall$$$**My organization's firewall might be preventing {{agent}} from collecting and sending metrics.**
:   If you're having issues with connecting your cluster to AutoOps and you suspect that a firewall may be the reason, refer to [](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/autoops-sm-troubleshoot-firewalls.md).

$$$custom-cert$$$**{{agent}} is failing to connect because it doesn't recognize my SSL certificate.**
:   If {{agent}} is failing to connect your cluster to AutoOps because it doesn't recognize your SSL certificate, refer to [](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/autoops-sm-custom-certification.md). 

$$$eck-no-clusters$$$**I went through the wizard with {{ECK}} (ECK) as my installation method, but I can't view any connected clusters in my account.** {applies_to}`eck: ga 3.3`
:   Refer to [](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/autoops-sm-troubleshoot-eck-no-clusters.md) to diagnose and resolve common issues.

## Run the AutoOps Connectivity Check

Run the [AutoOps Connectivity Check](../autoops/autoops-connectivity-check.md) to test your system and diagnose any issues that might prevent you from connecting your cluster to AutoOps.

## Potential errors

The following table shows the errors you might encounter if something goes wrong while you set up and use AutoOps in your clusters.

| Error code | Error message | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `HTTP_401` | Authentication failed | Connection denied because of an authentication error. Run the AutoOps Connectivity Check script to diagnose the issue. [Learn more](../autoops/autoops-connectivity-check.md). |
| `HTTP_502` | Server error | Received an invalid response from the server. There may be an issue with the server status or network configuration. Run the AutoOps Connectivity Check script to diagnose the issue. [Learn more](../autoops/autoops-connectivity-check.md). |
| `HTTP_503` | Server unavailable | Invalid or corrupt response received from the server. The server acting as a proxy may be busy or undergoing scheduled maintenance. If the issue persists, check the cluster's health and resource usage. |
| `HTTP_504` | Request timed out | Did not receive a response from the cluster within the expected time frame. Check the cluster's performance or consider changing your connection timeout settings. |
| `CLUSTER_ALREADY_CONNECTED` | Cluster connected to another account | This cluster is already connected to another {{ecloud}} organization. Disconnect it and then try again. |
| `CLUSTER_NOT_READY` | {{es}} cluster is still connecting | Your {{es}} cluster is not yet ready to connect. Wait a few moments for it to finish starting up and then try again. |
| `HTTP_0` | Connection error | {{agent}} couldn't connect to the cluster. Run the AutoOps Connectivity Check script to diagnose the issue. [Learn more](../autoops/autoops-connectivity-check.md). If the issue persists, contact [Elastic support](https://support.elastic.co/) (for clusters on an Enterprise or Platinum license) or visit the [community forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elastic-stack/monitoring/103). |
| `VERSION_MISMATCH` | {{es}} version is unsupported | Upgrade your cluster to a [supported version](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol). |
| `UNKNOWN_ERROR` | Installation failed | Could not install {{agent}}. Consult the [troubleshooting guide](../autoops/cc-cloud-connect-autoops-troubleshooting.md) or run the AutoOps Connectivity Check script to test your network settings. If the issue persists, contact [Elastic support](https://support.elastic.co/) (for clusters on an Enterprise or Platinum license) or visit the [community forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elastic-stack/monitoring/103). |
| `x509` | Certificate signed by unknown authority | {{agent}} couldn't connect. SSL certificate signed by unknown authority. |
